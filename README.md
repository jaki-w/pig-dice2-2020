## Description

_This project simulates the game of pig dice. Two users are able to play together and take turns rolling a single die. If the die roll is 1, the player's turn will end and all collected turn points will be lost. If the die roll is any other number(2-5) the user can choose to continue rolling or to press the hold button and have their collected turn points added to their total score. The first player to reach 100 points wins. This project utilizes two constructors with unique prototypes and functions._
